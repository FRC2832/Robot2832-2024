         * or put a different SD card in the robot, as this cleared some internal FPGA flag.

         * This specific change just lowers the threshold the Rio2 goes into brownout to 3V.  Because the
         * Rio2 needs 5.5V to run, the hardware will shutoff before brownout protection happens, and we
         * should never see Brownout Protection again.
